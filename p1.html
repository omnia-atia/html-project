Knowledge Representation: (Knowledge: Knowledge Representation and Knowledge Database), the representation of knowledge is the field of artificial intelligence that is concerned with enabling machines to think and make decisions, as this knowledge acquired by the machine is collected and stored in a database used to exchange knowledge and manage it, and is a reference for making any decisions  Intelligent may come from the machine. [13] Logical Reasoning and Probabilistic Reasoning, logical thinking in artificial intelligence is one of the different forms of thinking, as facts are deduced and deduced from available data, [14] and logical thinking corresponds to  What is known as probabilistic thinking, which takes the concept of probability and uncertainty from knowledge, in order to deal with all future uncertain circumstances, which may cause doubt about its occurrence. [15] Tools and platforms for artificial intelligence There are many tools available for learning artificial intelligence, including the following: [  16] Caffe Tool: This open source tool - meaning it is available for editing by anyone - was developed by Yangqin Jia as a message search  His PhD at the University of California, as this tool specializes in what is known as deep learning in artificial intelligence.  Deeplearning4j tool: It is a deep learning programming library written in Java language, and it is characterized by its ability to process big data, and like its predecessor, Deeplearning4j tool is open source.  IBM Watson Tool: It is a tool that allows its users to answer their questions with capabilities similar to human capabilities, this tool may be a source of assistance in providing commercial advice and optimal decision-making, as it protects the data of its users through encryption, and it is worth noting that this tool is only available in the English language.
