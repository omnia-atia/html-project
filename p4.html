Artificial intelligence, this open source tool is a library of what is known as machine learning.  Swift AI tool: This tool can work on Mac devices, and will soon be able to support the Linux system, as Swift AI allows its users to process signals, create deep learning algorithms, or even create neural networks in the field of artificial intelligence.  Torch Tool: It is an open source tool for the process of scientific computing within artificial intelligence, and this tool is characterized by its support for neural networks in artificial intelligence, its ability to perform linear algebra operations, and its support for the graphics processing unit.  CNTK tool: It is an open source tool that allows its users to combine different types of models of artificial intelligence, [17] This tool was developed by Microsoft. [16] Keras Tool: Python language was used to write this tool, which is a high library  The level of what is known as neural networks in the science of artificial intelligence, and is characterized by ease of use for those who have knowledge of deep learning. [16] [17] Scikit-Learn: Scikit-Learn is one of the most famous machine learning libraries in artificial intelligence, as it is possible through which  Data mining, analysis, and visual representation. [16] [17] Theano is a tool that works within the Python work environment, and deals with various mathematical and mathematical functions and functions such as arrays, [16] and this tool is characterized by its speed through a personal computer;  Not only does it use the CPU to do its job, it also uses the GPU along with the CPU;  [17] There are also numerous AI platforms that are concerned with machinery implementation of tasks similar to what humans <br>

do, in terms of responding, interacting with problems, or even learning, and here are some of the more common and used AI platforms  : [18] Microsoft Azure Machine Learning platform: It is an artificial intelligence platform provided by Microsoft, used through the cloud storage service, and enables its users to analyze data to facilitate business machine learning.  TensorFlow platform: An open source library developed by the Google Brain team, in which information is represented as <br>

graphs, and each part of this graph is a specific piece of information.  Infosys Nia: One of the AI platforms that is knowledge-based, then automates - automated - business processes and restructures its system again.  Wipro HOLMES: A platform that provides its users with many cognitive computing services.  To develop machines such as robots and drones.  Other AI platforms: API.AI, Premonition platform, Railbird platform, Agassi platform, Mind Meld platform, Wit platform, Vital A.I platform, KAI platform, Receptivity platform, Maya platform. Artificial intelligence applications There are many practical applications of artificial intelligence, and the most prominent of these applications are the following: [19] Games: Artificial intelligence systems are used in many electronic games;  That requires a dimension and strategic thinking, such as poker and chess, for example.  Interacting with the visual system: Some applications of artificial intelligence can interpret and analyze the images entered into them.  Such as facial recognition software, image analysis for positioning, and other similar applications.  Interacting with handwriting: This is through handwriting recognition applications, whether it is writing on paper or on the screen of the device itself.  Intelligent robots: Robots do a lot of different actions, as they can do the work that humans do, because of their ability to feel the surrounding factors such as light, heat, sound, or movement, 


through special sensors, and these robots are able to learn from their past experiences and benefit  Of errors. <br> Interacting with the spoken voice: Some artificial intelligence systems can be used to listen to speech and understand its meanings, even if it is pronounced with some noise or pronounced in colloquial or street language.  Provide advice and guidance: Some applications of artificial intelligence can provide advice and advice to human users in certain areas, such as the medical field, for example, by analyzing the symptoms of a disease to access the disease and treat it, for example.  The advantages of artificial intelligence
